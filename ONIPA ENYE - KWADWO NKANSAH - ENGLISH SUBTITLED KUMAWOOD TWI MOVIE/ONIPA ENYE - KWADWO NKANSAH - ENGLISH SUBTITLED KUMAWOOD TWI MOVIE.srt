What is the matter

56
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,839
The end of a man is indeed a sad one !!

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,039
What at all is the matter7

58
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,639
Sound of a cutlass

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,999
Gospi look at where I'm staying as a care taker

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,039
This place...

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,519
What has it done?

62
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,079
You withness the time i came, it was like a thick forest

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,999
We all know 11

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,079
Look al how i have struggled with different kinds of snakes in this house

65
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,359
I tried all my best and killed all these snakes for it to be a better place to stay

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,719
All these pythons, Gospi you know what I'm talking about

67
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,679
You shouldn't be surprise if you are walking with animals of all this kind

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,359
The income of staying in someones house as a care taker is; fighting with reptiles.

69
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,359
We come to stay in animals kingdom, why are you so surprised

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,639
As for last time I almos” slc:'t .. ‘h a sgaike in my room, if it hadn't been the drig iw againsr snakes

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,479
are you sure you have snakes drug?

72
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,119
Oh yes i had a little if it, when i went to the North.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,078
That's how i have tried to make this house a better place, it hasn't even been that better

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,398
You have done well, it's a house now.

75
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,639
Ofcourse...

76
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:29,399
My landlord always comes from the city and congratulate me for keeping here clean

77
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,159
Last time he came and i wanted to welcome him but he refused me.

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,359
and i said oh why landlord, I respect you a lot

79
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,039
and He told me the house is almost completed, so He is coming to complete it

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,479
Trouble has come 1 *

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,199
so that my grandchildren will come and stay in, so pack from the house

82
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,359
The landlord told you to leave?

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,959
I should leave

84
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,679
And i said oh my landlord

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,959
PROVERB....

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,879
He said what is the meaning?

87
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,599
And I said, Eeii an elder who doesn"t understand proverbs

88
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,359
I was the one that made this house a better one

89
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,199
and is not an abomination for a helper to enjoy his handy work

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,919
To cut long story short, He is giving me three days to leave

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,399
And i said oh please i beg you,

92
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,319
The law gives three months to sack someone from your house.

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,519
Do you even know what you are saying7

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,079
Why

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,679
have you rented a house to be given three months to move out?

96
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,079
No I took- care of it.

97
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,359
NO NO, let me tell you...

98
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,399
The misunderstanding between care takers and landlords is move'out, I'm moving in

99
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,999
eave I'm coming to complete my house

100
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,599
Unexpectedly, they will sack you out, and you become stranded like frog

101
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,239
Then He has played me too

102
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,919
And then i said oh landlord

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,879
And I begged him to give me the corner of the house to sleep, but he said no

104
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,399
and oneday is even off from the three days he gave me to move out

105
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,319
So Gospi I beg you, as for you i know you

106
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,079
If you can help me lodge at your place for free"

Why have you turn all the responsibilities in this world upon me to struggle

179
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,919

You have been moving from one place to the other like a butterfly

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,839
We always on the run, till we have landed ourselves in this uncompleted house

Thay said it, that women are ungrateful

192
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,119

Women are opportunist to the extent that they don’t want to pass through.a day of labor

197
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,279
The time I was with you in the beginning,

And I was struggling here and there 24/7 as you were enjoying

199
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,079
You did nt say anything

251
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,279

257
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,039
Oh okay, Ermm Ofori

258
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,439
Let me tell you something

259
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,959
This world we are in

260
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,439
You won't be successful if you don't choose to be wise

261
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,959
If you don't bully you can never be successful

262
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,599
Eeii ’

263
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,119
And if you dont use your brains you can never be successful

264
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,079
Because

265
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,719
Someone’s money is in the pocket of another's

266
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,119
Someone's money is in the pocket of another's

267
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,919
How can you collect your

268
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,199
You have to be wise and use your brains

269
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,519
There is always direction if you don't know

270
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,839
Do you^understand 7

271
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,519
No huge matter comes with a notice

272
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,519
I alone knows what people have been doing in this world

273
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,799
We the ones that can't build houses with our own money,

274
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,439
but stays in people's houses

275
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,759
vThey bully us alot

276
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,119
So is about time we are also using JUJU to snatch all their houses

277
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,959
And that will be all for you

278
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,119

And I have been giving you directions for your place to be permanent for you

282

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,999
Because I'm wiser and older than you are

289
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,759
I know alot than you do know

290
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,879
This is the road to success and you saying no

291
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,599
How can you be successful ?

292
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,679
Oh but Twum it hasn't gotten to slapping

I havent slaped you yet, but if you dont be careful i will slap you

295
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,599
Hmmm U

296
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,079
Ofcourse Twum you said it, that I should use JUJU on my lanlord to take the house permanently

297
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,959
But before God and man...

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,359
Everybody knows I'm a catholic

299
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,199
I have been Baptized and goes for communion, i want to go to heaven

300
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,199
So as for that I cant do it

301
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,839
Good

302
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,199
As for me I'm a fool

303
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,199
can't do that

304
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,599
I'm a fool that is why I have occupy a full house all by myself

305
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,319
Een no you are not a fool

306
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,399
Jesus didnt see when you were been sacked away?

307
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,199
Ernn Jesus

308
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,159
Why couldn't he send one of his angels to come rent apartment for you7

309
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,039
That’s what surprises me

310
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,359
Then know that Jesus is bad

311
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,239
Romans killed Jesus

312
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,759
Pilato is a Roman

313
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,079
Herode is a Roman

314
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,839
Amerado is also a Roman

315
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,359
They ve say it

316
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,399
Why did they crucified Jesus

317
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,599
So if you have really taken Jesus, then continue his work

318
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,599
We don't crucify in Ghana but you will suffer as you are in now

319
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,119
So Ofori there is nothing wrong

320
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,759
But i will even charge you to pay 100 cedis to even sleep beneath of my bed every month

321
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,679
Eeiiii !!!

322
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,239

MICHEAL JACKSO'N H!

331
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,199
Hold on we will talk later

332
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,719
Are you deaf 7

333
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,879
Akua what is it ?

334
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,159
I have been shouting your name all this while,or you have forgotten your name?

335
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,199
Give me my money

336
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,079
Which money again?

337
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,079
So you dont pay utility bills and water bills do you want me to pay for you?

338
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,439
Ahh ?

339
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,879
But you collected both together

340
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,759
Can you imagine 7

341
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,919
Can you imagine ?

342
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,799
You even made me pay rent for your bathroom

343
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,719
But if I compare to a hotel here is cool

344
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,079
Why do you want to mke me feel bad

345
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,879
If you stand in court and tells the judge

346
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,399
that when I was collecting money for the rent, i also made you pay utilities

347
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
He will say you dont think

348
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,919
He will say you are mad ’’

349
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,879
How can you pay for a utility you haven't even used?

350
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,239
Or you didn't hear me when I said it?

351
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,799
AHH !!

352
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,359
How can you say I have collected you money for bathroom

353
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,399
Have you scrub the bathroom in this house before

354
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,399
I always scrub the bathroom all the time

355
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,879
And is all this same money, I use to buy detergent

356

How could I take good care of a place and being sack later to rent a room

700
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,999
would be a fool to acept that

701

708
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,519
And He came here ranting, And I told him I could slap him for what he is saying

00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,159
You should have slapped him

710
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,239
You should have slapped him, Koo Fori is very foolish

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,199

911
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,599
This house is for my niece

912
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,519
oh so is not for you?

913
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,399
no I'm building for my niece

914
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,359
But where is yours ?

915
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,719

916
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,199

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,359
that is my house too you understand

919
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,879
but he is^n'ot in town

920
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,879
he stays in Germany

921
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,039
small small

922
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,559
the reason I brought you here is to weed and jeep here clean and tidy

923
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,639
for here to be^jean and nice

924
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,399
all the time

925
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,759
don’t worry, how can I stay in such a nice house and not keep here clean

926
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,359
If we talk about care takers across the country

927
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,879
I am the king of care takers since I started life

928
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,999
I am the president of care takers,

929
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,359
Because I started as a kid and I have been like thTs^since then as a care taker

930
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,399
untill we are here as you are giving me this house

931
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,719
soj'm a king in it

932
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,159
I have introduce a lot of people into this work

933
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,519
really ??

934
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,719
I havej^romote some people

935
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,199

936
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,599
yes I have people if you want, I will let therrrcome stay in there for you

937
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,399
so asffor that, I'm the king

938
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,519
but now you are no more part of care takers

939
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,039
Hmmm

940
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,279
because if you do goods unto others, others will do good unto you

941
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,199
If you be a good person to my niece, that is all.

942
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,119
there wouldn't be any problem

943
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,639

944
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,759

okay

954
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,199
some gave me a house earlier on

955
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,399
there was nothing in the house

956
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,719
he had to think about us

957
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,319
is there a bed in there7

958
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,079
No there is no bed

959
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,079
but you have a bed bring it when you coming

960
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,879
as for my bed really

961
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,159

963
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,239
I can't carry all that here

964
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,439

everyhouse that a care taker is in, I am the ,6ne that gave to him or her

1092
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,879
because since my child hood, GOD created me in such a way that-I-can't build a house

1093
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,799
As for me I think you have build your own

1094

Me too I’m not married, we all dating

because marriage is difficult these days

1103

people don't like it sake of the court endorsement

1104
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,639
because will be a fool to bring someone's daughter to building like this

1105
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,559
No, I will marry if I complete my own house

playing like an intrument

1197
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,559
like that of roman c-atholic's instrument or methodist

1198
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,119
OH my GOD, GOD really created buttocks

1199

You have really done well

1200
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,159
if you watch over someone's property well, the owner will always be happy

1201
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,559
I'm also thankful

1202
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,919
Yaa stop, madam is coming

1203
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,559
you are doing it yourself today

1204
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,559
yes mom

1205
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,319
you have done well

1206
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,839
madam this is where I was begging you

1207
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,599
that lets use this sand

1208
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,999
there is cement already, if only the mason's will come then we finish portion

1209
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,719
mm mm

1210
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,399
sake of the erosion

1211
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,679
I made my mind that when they working on the upperside then they add it too

1212
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,599
but for the ground, sake of the frequent rainfall you have to weed always

1213
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,919
I weed it oo but

1214
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,679
it will always come up after a heavy rainfall

1215
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:15,999
ï»¿

1216
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,319
so I made my mind that if

1217
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,639
so I made my mind that if got something I will spray it

1218
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,639
because it always comes up easily

1219
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,399
ernn I think that one will be better

1220
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,359
so all of it could die

1221
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,639

Twum Banmah is really a barrier

00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,199
what will we do if not him

1466
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,239
what?

1467
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,959
it is very wise to do so-

1468
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,879
let me tell you

1469
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:10,799
I have told you before that we have to wash your brains at the car wash center

1470
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,199

but she invited me in to, stay here so that I can prepare'myself

1479
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,719
your friend has told me this and I'm telling you, you are here supporting him?

1480
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,319

let me tell you

1483
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,239
this world we are living in

1484
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,679
if you don't be vigilant*

1485
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,279
and use your sense to snatch things from people you own anything in this world

1486
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,079
you are really surprising me

1487
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,439
why do you have to be surprised?

1488
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,439

01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,319
I can never commit this kind of sin

1505
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,159
what is wrong about what I'm telling you

1506
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,839

you have really asked a question

1816
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,719
I 'don't Ing® this lady

anywhere ^ this world

1817
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,719
since my brother started this house

1818
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,759
and she came to plead with us to get her a p-lace to live

1819
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,519
and I was like, how could you stay in a house that hasn’t been roofed

1820
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,199
she said no, we should let her come in

1821
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,079
so we let her in, as a care taker

1822
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,639
and this is it

1823
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,719
so this house is not for Akua GospP

1824
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,679
does she have a peny to build a house7

1825

I couldn't be a thief when the crisis came?

2015
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,479
I had to sell some of it to survive

2016
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,199
so as I was selling then train too was also'taking part away

2017

01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,279

2188
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,439
is true

2189
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,279
I already alerted you guys before this meeting

2190
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,479
sod

2191
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,999
so you have discussed wifh each o'thef

2192
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:56,919
Is now that we all have got time to do this meeting

2193
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,039
so we don't have to waste time on this meeting

2194
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:06,079
so this is the actual time has come forth

2195
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,719
so today is today

2196
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,399
I won't stretch this issue

2197
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:11,959
v r

2198
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,079
the main reason why I called you is

2199
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:15,439
ï»¿

2200
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,519
things have change this time around

2201
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,919
so from now unwards

2202
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:32,839
anyone who will give his money to Gospi concerning this house, is at your own risk

2203
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,519
because if some arguements comes in terms of money issues

2204
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,599
and I ask you for yours

2205
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,199
and you tell me you have given it to Gospi

2206
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,599
Errmm

2207
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:50,439
I won't be able to face Gospi about it

2208
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:54,039
you would have to pay again

2209
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,639
that is why I am alerting you from today for you to be aware

2210
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:03,639
so it won't be like as if you didn't hear

2211
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:15,599
so if anyone have anything to say about what I just said, he can bring it out

2212
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,999
okay, I don't understand somethings

2213
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:24,879
so if I heard you right, the house is not for Gospi?

2214
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,279
woman the house is not for her!

2215
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,319
Eenii1!

2216
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:39,919
Errm Bogi let me explain to her since she has asked

2217
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:40,439
ï»¿

2218
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,879
this house there

2219
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:43,559


v»

2220
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:50,639
is for my elder brother who lives in the states

2221
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:56,719
for Gospi, I wouldn't say she is a stranger because we have known her for a while

2222
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,279
Awe are familiar now so L know her

2223
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,399
but she is not a family but a stranger \

2224
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,159
eeii we are dead

2225
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,959
so she came to beg for a-place t'o live

2226
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:10,599
truthfully the house wasn't even roofed when she came in

2227
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,879
so she came in as a care taker

2228
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,759
till this time

2229
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,399
so that is what it is

2230
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,439
what is that supposed to mean?

2231
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:26,759
I wouldn't want to go there Agya Fori, whatever the case is

2232
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,519
you are even surprising'

2233
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,359
Gospi had ti be here whiles you saying all this, or has she travel?

2234
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,919
as for me I fought with her oo

2235
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,119
I have told her that if she mistakenly cross me, I will deal with her

2236
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:43,359
she is really disrespectful as shit

2237
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,599
.so'as'tor me I have given her a warning, and you have to becareful with her too

2238
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:50,639
you die when she enounters you with trouble and I don't want to die

2239
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,119
from here I am going to my house

2240
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,479
so you are at risk right now

2241
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,599
so Borga's even know proverbs?

2242
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:02,319
what can't you do if you are staying with Gospi, of what she is letting us go thru

2243
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,879
if I unerstand you well

2244
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:17,519
if the.house is not for Gpspi, why would you let her be in charge all this while?

2245
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:22,679
Akwasi, Akwasi, I hatejwhat you are doing

2246
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,639
didn't I pay rent, when I came in h'ece?

2247
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:26,159
that-is the same money she uses to feed you

2248
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,239
look at what you saying7

2249
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,159
are you not dating her?

2250
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,239
tenant who is dating a landlord

2251
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:35,639
becareful if you are how coming to be n charge of here, he*like’s cheap things

2252
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,319
ï»¿

2253
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:36,959

mmmm

2256
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:46,239
I will curse you if exchange contacts with her

2257
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:51,039
crmm Borgi let me explain to him to clear-things out

2258
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,159
ermmm brother

2259
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,399
ease

2260
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,399
as you asked

2261
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,079
as you a'ske^d

2262
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:55,439
' 4\ '-

2263
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,359
the truth is 1

2264
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:02,479
we didn't hear all these dealings when it started

2265
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:09,239
it was too late by the time we heard and we have pardon her for that

2266
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:14,319
we don't want it to happen again, that is why we are putting measures in place

2267
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:21,839
so that nobody can claim some ownership along the line

2268
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:25,999
that is why we are making you aware that from now unwards

2269
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,279
events have turned

2270
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:31,039
so like I said earlier on

2271
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,439
we decided to let things slide

2272
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:38,879
but now wc have noticed that if we don't take care things will go bad

2273
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:45,679
so now, new king new law

2274
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,279
ï»¿

2275
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,919
so Gospi is not the landlord

2276
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:57,959
and she has been disturbing us this way? we will deal with her

2277
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,199

haven't seen anything like that before

2311
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:19,759
I struggled myself to build my house

2312
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,519
why don't they wanna let me have my peace of mind

2313
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,439
or is it a surprise or hatred

2314
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:33,479
or the love I have got is what pains them, that I have to also get my lover?

2315
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,799
maybe is the love you have got, is no big deal

2316
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,919

2317
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:41,519

2325
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,559
look if you know you will join them

2326

we come.in peace, this is my sister konadu, she stays in the OS

2611
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:35,319
she sent money to my uncle for a house to live in when she comes

2612
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,999
so when sbecame, she asked him-abbut the house

but he can't show us th^house, all he say is the house is miss7n§?

2614
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,519
we don't even understand

2615
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,079
A house can got missing

2616
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:50,679
m.ummy-th'is.is very^irprising; J* I am aware of everthing that is'goin on

2617

I didn't even know that a whole house can get missing

2618
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:03,599
you may think this is some story but the truth, he cannot show us the house

2619
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:15,439
it was very-irritating, so I decided to come to you because I'know what you can do

01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,959
is only GOD that can help you and not me

2623
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:34,279
we will all fast for thre^ays thaCis where GOD will reveaT things to us all

2624
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,719
and then we all work on it together

01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,559
Jzhe.sad-thihg is.y^loosing^ your property'to sorffeone else

2626
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:42,319
the sad thing is you loosing your property to someone else

2627
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:47,519
so after the fastingGOD will show us a way

can you please go straight to the point

2642
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:13,679
so you want them to kill you before you know what is going on

2643
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:14,879
something is really going on, you should know

2644

can you please go straight to the point?

2645
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:27,999
you ask your brother what is really going on between him and Gospi

2646
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:32,279
sometimes I feel like they are dating, how tBt2y speak on phone

2647
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,759
that is why she might be behaving like that

2648
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,519
no no that is not true, my brother is not like that

2649
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:39,279

one deals with spare parts so I want you to join them as a shop keeper

2821
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:34,599
at the end of the day you will get something for yourself and your niece

2822
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:39,239
than to stay at home without doing anything

2823
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:43,439
first of all thank you very much

/ A\ A \-r ? -

2825
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:55,119

PROVERB...

2828
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:08,839
why will I reject working to help my own self I’m I a fool7

2829
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,439
I grab it madam

2830
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:14,879
and I thank you very much for thinking about me

2831
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:18,839
and what you are doing to me, I don't know when I can repay

2832
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:20,879
I thank you

2833
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:23,039
GOD. only deserves to be thanked

2834
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:32,599
and secondly, I know its hard to say but I have to say it

2835
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:39,239
you know how I be paying rent all this while at my current place to landlord

2836
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:45,479
and I really pay a huge amount of money

2837
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:52,879
so since my rent ended I have been thinking about what I'm going to do

2838
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:55,719
It's very worrisome

2839
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:02,839
and with your help the house is now a better place now

2840
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:08,119
So I want to come and stay here

2841
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:13,319
I donit wanna pay any money to any landlord again but complete this and move in

2842
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:21,879
so if I should build a two bed room for you back there with your niece

2843
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:25,039
or I should rent some place for you

2844
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,919
tell me whatever you want so I could know what to do

2845
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:30,319
madam I thank you again for the first time

2846
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:31,839
don't thank me man.

2847
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:37,999
I knew what you wanted to say when you started talking

2848
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,799
because I have heard it many times

2849
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:50,439
it doen’t make any sense for you to rent a house whiles you have this here

2850
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:53,159
everybody has come to live in their own in this area

2851
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:56,399
so I thank idea is not bad

2852
02:08:56,840 --> 02:09:03,479
but I can't force you to build me a boys quarters or rent me a room

2853
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:09,439
will do whatever you tell me to do sake of what you have done for me

2854
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:13,399
you are giving me a job and at the same time thinking about where I will sleep

2855
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:16,479
you are not even in but you arc thinking about me and where I will sleep

2856
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:19,199
It means you think and care about human

2857
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:29,279
some landlords won't let you even come back from work but will move you out

2858
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:48,759
how some Gare takers also use various means to dupe the house later he is been sacked

2859
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:54,679
if every lanlord have such kindness in this’ world, the world would be a better place

2860
02:09:54,760 --> 02:10:00,239
we have to all gam something from each other but not one sided

2861
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:06,519
don't let-this kindness end here but extend it to the everywhere you go

2862
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:06,879
>& n

2863
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,719
there is blessings in giving that receiving

2864
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:13,359
and GOD will always replace your loses

2865
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:18,919
so everything you are willing to do for us, we will manage

2866
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:26,919
oh okay because, If I try to let them build it might take some time

2867
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:28,639
so I will rent a place for you

2868
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:35,719
that wil also let me work hard because I know I have a rent to pay

2869
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:42,359
Yaa speaks english with me when she comes back from school and that is because of you
