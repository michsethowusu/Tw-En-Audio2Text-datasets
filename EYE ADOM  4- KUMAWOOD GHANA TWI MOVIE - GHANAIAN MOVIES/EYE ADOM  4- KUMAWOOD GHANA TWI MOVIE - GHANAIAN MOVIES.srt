So what are you doing up there?

7
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,098
I wanted to go and sell this,and send him to his hometown with the proceeds and take care of him there.

I'm just coming from his house.

His wife told you he is notaround?

I spoke with him this morning and hejs.at home.

So she was lying to me?

19
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,433
I don't even know what is wrong with that woman.

20
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:15,772
See how powerful pastor is,instead of the woman to be supportive,she is rather pulling him down.

21
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,990
How can a pastor's wife lie like that?

22
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,243
Uncle it's the pastor's wife you are talking about.

23
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,163
Let me say it because she has done enough.

Let me say it because she has done enough.

25
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,336
You are in trouble and you need the pastor.

26
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,422
If he dies,it's because she lied to you.

27
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,634
Just calm down.

28
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,015
Don't go and sell anything. I will go and call the pastor myself.

For him to come and pray for him.
