That is how your mother lived a reckless life.

126
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,770
She brought me up the same way you brought her up to be reckless.

384
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,406
One more thing.

385
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,643
Are you really serious to marry my sister?

386
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,278
She is the reason I am here.

387
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,648
I don't care much about my family

388
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:19,889
I am not surprised at all that you don't care about your family.

389
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:31,834
But you need to have a background knowledge .

390
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:40,109
I am giving you some information. You need to ask her but not now.

391
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,313
There is a uy who has been spoiling er with money.

00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:45,982
He is Musah.

393
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:55,458
He has been giving her guinea fowls and she has fallen for it.

ï»¿

395
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,997
You know rich ladies fall for just anything small.

396
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:01,998
You mean who?

397
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,134
Who else are we talking about here?

398
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,707
They broke up just about 4 months ago.

399
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:14,577
So do your background checks.

400
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,222
Be careful so you are not decieved by any rumours.

401
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,826
The food is ready.

402
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,403

You don't know Musah who has been supplying us with meat?

406
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:00,423
We sorted ourselves out already. We will be fine.

407
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:01,591
ï»¿

408
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,669
I am going to bring the food here.

409
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,272
Or you would join me as I go?

410
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,414
Who is Musah?

411
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,585
Are you taking her serious?

412
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:33,790

Pepe listen, I was just playing on your wits..

421
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:20,136
I said that to test how serious about her.

422
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,805
You know she is the only child of her parents

423
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,577
and w^e don't want any man to disturb her.

424

I now see that you reaNy love her.

425
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,983
I can recall the change in your face.

426
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,219
Some games are very dangerous.

I;haye to leave this area.

428
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,036
The lights just went out again.

429
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:57,740

431
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:11,854

433
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,361

You oan't be shouting 041 me like that.

Shut up and let me talk.

440
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:02,805
You are just the landlord's girlfriend and you are doing this?

441
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,177
Your grandmother grew up with my own grandmother.

442
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:13,449
Y®ur grandmother spent all her money OH sweets

443
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,183
She didn't think of buying a land.

444
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,785
She didn't think ®f buying a land.

445
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,691
Settle down with one man.

446
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,330

ï»¿

451
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:42,578
I don't understand why people say how they struggled to build and rent it out.

452
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:47,049
When we were girls, we used what we have to get what we want.

453
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:48,117
I will not sleep with such a man for anything.

454
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:52,188
I willnot sleep with such a man for anything.

455

Take care of your grand mother.

459
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,410
Bring your light bill.

460
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:20,416
Even with my ugly face, I made money from men to care for my mother.

461
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,519
If you want to beg for her, open the bag and pay for her.

462
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:28,791
Get ®ut of here with your shameful acts.

-Get out of here with your pride.

463
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:32,628
If we had not kept these furniture here, Would you get a place for your friend?

464
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,466
Are you not out of your mind

465
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,970
This lady can really talk.

466
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,373
I wish you could stay here for about two hours.

467
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,610
How do you mean by that?

468
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:49,378
How do you mean by that?

469
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,547
Have we, mentioned anybody's name?

470
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,587
Has a man hired a single room for you before?

471
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,522
Yes.

472
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,859
Then you are better than your friend so advise her.

473
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:08,564
I don't understand why some bush girls get some men to..

474
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:11,033
Where is the light bill?

-I don't have it.

475
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,439

477
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,446
These are the reasons I don't discuss my issues in this house.

00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,114
You have to leave this place.

479
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,649
It doesn't fit you to be here.

480
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:31,353
Haven't I told you about this before?

481
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:37,793
So why did you wait till now?

482
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:43,632
You tiave to leave this place. It's embarrasing.

483
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:49,305

I have been drilled by just 2 teenage boys in front of your house.

490

01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:34,582
Not even the president.

719
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:14,822
ï»¿

720
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:25,566
Why are you not giving me the chance to explain what happened to you?

721
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:26,367
ï»¿

722
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,236
ï»¿

723
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:28,870
ï»¿

724
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:33,441
I know this is your house and I will leave if you don't need me.

725
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:37,378
But y©u give me a chance to explain myself.

726
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:43,451
You have done it already so what else? I have not done anything.

727
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,761
The harm has already been caused. There was no harm in what you saw.

728
01:13:56,131 --> 01:14:01,135
She came to me for a new dress because her own got torn.

729
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:07,141
For your sake I couldn't throw her out.

730
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:12,713
There was nothing bad in what you came to see.

731
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:27,462
So you came all the way from your house t«® tell me this story?

732
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:41,509
I am not here t® convince you but try t® understand me.

733
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:48,216
She is your friend and I met her through you.

734
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:33,995
ï»¿

735
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,157
How are you

-I am fine

736
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:08,296
I am happy I met you.

I board your car because I respect you

737
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:17,138
I know and I picked you because of your beauty.

738
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:27,214
What is your name? -Empress, the blessed.

739
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:34,221
It is even in the bible.

740
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:45,566
When Joshua was going to the new land his concubine was Empress.

741
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:54,208
Because the girl was blessed, she got to the land first and prepared it.

742
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:08,956
I will be meeting a business partner in a hotel and I am not gBing to leave you.

743
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:16,230
I have an appointment with my pastor

744
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:23,204
I am a treasurer at church and I have to give him the church money.

745
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:30,011
I don't go to hotels. The bi&le even speaks against it.

746
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:41,656
When somebody see me around a hotel and tell my pastor, I will be in trouble.

747
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:48,029
Let me correct you. What you read is in Psalm 1.

748
01:17:52,367 --> 01:18:01,809
The hotels are not for bad things. It is for business men.

749
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:07,615
I can't transact my gold business in a private home for security reasons.

750
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:13,521
You tan't go to heaven ^ith your gold so don't talk about it with much pride.

751
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:18,526
I supply gold to Nyame Akwan in Obuasi.

752
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,396
I also walk yyith gr^eat men of God. Among them is Ben York.

753
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:31,038
I have heard much about him. My prophet is Prophet 1.

754
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:37,278
I am very much particular about your gold business.

755
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:42,983
Do you have lincense?

Sure. As a business man I have it.

756
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:44,585
Do you buy them your self or you just keep them for others?

757
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:50,858
I buy them for the exporters. So you send it through the exporters.

758
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:56,630
I always walk with mone so your lift

759
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:01,435
I wouldn't go with you to t-he hotel but from the way we are knowing ...

760
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:04,371
each other, I am begining to like you

761
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:11,946
To convert somebody to Christ is persuation. I wish you could join me..

762
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:16,317
...at church next week. So I will go with you to the hotel.

763
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:25,626
But I want you to promise me that you have canceled your bad intentions

764
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:39,874
Don't be taken over by any bad intentions as the devil tempted Jesus.

765
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:49,950
There would be no tests. I want God to use me to'Change your life.

766
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:58,726
I want you to experience new and good things in your life.

767
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:05,866
Please it hasn't gotten t® that. Let's be fri'ends first.

768
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:11,005
I will show yotu where I live but for now I want to know yours.

769
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,606
Let's g® t® my hotel.
