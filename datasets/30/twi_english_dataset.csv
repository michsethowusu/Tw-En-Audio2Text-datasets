twi_clips\twi_clip_101.wav,﻿What are you talking about?
twi_clips\twi_clip_102.wav,﻿Did she insult you or me?
twi_clips\twi_clip_103.wav,﻿Have you forgotten you gave me a message for Obe iiSi?
twi_clips\twi_clip_104.wav,﻿Yes!
twi_clips\twi_clip_105.wav,﻿I promise you that I delivered the message just as you told me.
twi_clips\twi_clip_106.wav,﻿Did it work?!
twi_clips\twi_clip_107.wav,﻿She has insulted you mercilessly.
twi_clips\twi_clip_108.wav,﻿What you are saying proves that point!
twi_clips\twi_clip_109.wav,﻿I told you to spice it up.
twi_clips\twi_clip_110.wav,﻿I told you to take a malt drink before you go ahead with it.
twi_clips\twi_clip_111.wav,﻿Do you understand?
twi_clips\twi_clip_112.wav,﻿How close you are to the girl
twi_clips\twi_clip_113.wav,﻿is the reason I assigned this to you.
twi_clips\twi_clip_114.wav,﻿Why have you come here to tell me stories?
twi_clips\twi_clip_115.wav,﻿I don't understand the stories you're telling me.
twi_clips\twi_clip_116.wav,﻿Ohemaa said she's not interested in your type of man.
twi_clips\twi_clip_117.wav,﻿You don't even come close.
twi_clips\twi_clip_118.wav,﻿She prefers a man with good job and a lot of money.
twi_clips\twi_clip_119.wav,"﻿Stop talking, Appau."
twi_clips\twi_clip_120.wav,"﻿You know when we talk about a man in this station,"
twi_clips\twi_clip_121.wav,﻿no other man matters!
twi_clips\twi_clip_122.wav,﻿I am very much aware of that
twi_clips\twi_clip_123.wav,﻿You don't even matter.
twi_clips\twi_clip_124.wav,﻿How could I be?
twi_clips\twi_clip_125.wav,﻿Why then is she insulting me?
twi_clips\twi_clip_126.wav,﻿Ohemaa said you're not her class
twi_clips\twi_clip_127.wav,﻿and that you don't know anything.
twi_clips\twi_clip_128.wav,"﻿The kinds of things Ohemaa said,"
twi_clips\twi_clip_129.wav,﻿I will not understand this Appau.
twi_clips\twi_clip_130.wav,﻿Ohemaa can't insult me that way.
twi_clips\twi_clip_131.wav,﻿I watched her quietly and I was shocked because I knew Ohemaa as a humble person.
twi_clips\twi_clip_132.wav,﻿I never knew she could be so nasty.
twi_clips\twi_clip_133.wav,﻿How she insulted you I'd poison myself if I were you.
twi_clips\twi_clip_134.wav,﻿You're my friend but I have to be honest with you.
twi_clips\twi_clip_135.wav,﻿How much you hate bathing that I keep talking to you about
twi_clips\twi_clip_136.wav,﻿is partly to blame.
twi_clips\twi_clip_137.wav,﻿You were smelly when you went to the girl and that's why she didn't agree to your proposal.
twi_clips\twi_clip_138.wav,﻿I should go and present my case myself.
twi_clips\twi_clip_139.wav,﻿Can you do that?
twi_clips\twi_clip_140.wav,﻿I'll open her understanding.
twi_clips\twi_clip_141.wav,﻿Can you do that?
twi_clips\twi_clip_142.wav,"﻿The last one who scarier than her but still,"
twi_clips\twi_clip_143.wav,﻿I got her.
twi_clips\twi_clip_144.wav,﻿How much more Ohemaa?
twi_clips\twi_clip_145.wav,﻿Okay then.
twi_clips\twi_clip_146.wav,﻿Go to Accra and take your bath since that's where there's clean water before approaching her.
twi_clips\twi_clip_147.wav,﻿I'll win Ohemaa over.
twi_clips\twi_clip_148.wav,﻿I've heard you.
twi_clips\twi_clip_149.wav,﻿I'm now going upstairs for water to sell.
twi_clips\twi_clip_150.wav,﻿So if after everything you still want to approach her yourself
twi_clips\twi_clip_151.wav,﻿then go right ahead.
twi_clips\twi_clip_152.wav,"﻿Okay, go."
twi_clips\twi_clip_153.wav,﻿You can only win her over with a charm.
twi_clips\twi_clip_154.wav,"﻿You are my friend and I asked you to do something for me,"
twi_clips\twi_clip_155.wav,﻿You don't like bathing so the girl walked out on you.
twi_clips\twi_clip_156.wav,﻿You've come back to tell me you didn't get her.
twi_clips\twi_clip_157.wav,﻿I'll personally approah her.
twi_clips\twi_clip_158.wav,﻿No one called you yet you rushed over.
twi_clips\twi_clip_159.wav,﻿You should learn to be patient.
twi_clips\twi_clip_160.wav,﻿Did he call you
twi_clips\twi_clip_161.wav,﻿You are not patient.
twi_clips\twi_clip_162.wav,﻿Are you the only one here to make money?
twi_clips\twi_clip_163.wav,﻿You need to learn to be patient.
twi_clips\twi_clip_164.wav,﻿Did the woman call you?
twi_clips\twi_clip_165.wav,﻿Do just that!
twi_clips\twi_clip_166.wav,﻿Don't come with me anymore!
twi_clips\twi_clip_167.wav,﻿I won't mind you.
twi_clips\twi_clip_168.wav,﻿Get lost!
twi_clips\twi_clip_169.wav,﻿Which strategy did you use to sell your things?
twi_clips\twi_clip_170.wav,﻿Which strategy did you use to sell yourHhing??
